**Challenges | Comments**

* I used a tutorial to make this portfolio. Actually, I used several tutorials.
* I did not have a hard time coding this portfolio. However, I lack artistic talent, 
and thus used many tutorial to graps a design.
* In an ideal world, I would like the user to be able to send me their information. I technically could store it 
in local storage, but I dont want user information to be compromised. So I think once I purchase a URL, I will set it up.
* I need more projects that put me out against my peers. So I will try to work on side projects when I can.
* ALSO, I cannot update my LinkedIn and resume at the moment. I do not want my current employeers to know I am taking this 
program. They will get anxious learning I will be leaving soon, and that could cause a rough couple of months.
